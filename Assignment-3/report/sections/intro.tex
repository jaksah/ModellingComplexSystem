The direction of movement in animal groups depends on social interaction and the knowledge of certain group members. 
If some group members know where to find food, they will hopefully lead the rest of the group there. 
But how many informed members are required as a function of group size in order to lead the rest if they don't communicate? 
This project implements a model that simulates the movement of a group where the members are oblivious of which members, if any, know where to go.

This report will focus upon the accuracy and elongation of the group for varying portion of informed individuals and group size. 
Due to limitations in execution times, the report will be restricted to a group size of maximum 100 individuals, and portions varying from 0 to 1 with a step size of 0.1.
