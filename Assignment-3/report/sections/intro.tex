The direction of movement in animal groups depends on social interaction and the knowledge of certain group members. If some group members know where to find food, they will hopefully lead the rest of the group there. But how much knowledge is required as a function of group size in order take the leadership? This project implements a model that simulates the movement of a group where the members are oblivious of which members, if any, know where to go.
