If a group of informed individuals are moving in the \emph{front line} of the group, these informed group will walk in a circular shape, making a quadratic bounding box surrounding them. 
The rest of the group will follow the informed group, so that if there are the same number of uninformed individuals as informed, they will together make up a bounding box with elongation of about 2, meaning that the side of the bounding box parallel to the direction is twice as long as the side perpendicular to the direction.

From the definition of Elongation, see \ref{sub:elongation}, we can put up a master equation for the elongation. With a distance between particles of length $\alpha$ we can define the parameters in Figure \ref{fig:distr_direction} as
\begin{align}
	h\cdot w &= N \\
	w &= (\sqrt{Np}-1)\alpha.
\end{align}
The elongation is calculated as 
\begin{equation}
	E = \frac{h}{w} = \frac{N}{(\alpha(\sqrt{Np}-1))^2}.
\end{equation}
