These results are based on the assumptions that the $Np$ informed individuals are guiding and moving in front of the rest, that they move in a circle making a quadratic bounding box around them, and that all individuals maintain a homogenous density with distance $\alpha$ to each other. This justifies the approximation illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:distr}. There will effectively be $Np\omega$ guiding individuals if the weight $\omega$ is taken into account.

From the definition of Elongation, see section \ref{sub:elongation}, we can formulate an approximation of the elongation that is valid when the informed individuals have enough influence to guide the rest. With a distance between particles of length $\alpha$ we can define the parameters in Figure \ref{fig:distr_direction} as
\begin{align}
	h &= (\sqrt{Np\omega}-1)\alpha \\
	w & = (\frac{N}{\sqrt{Np\omega}} -1) \alpha.
\end{align}
The elongation is calculated as 
\begin{equation}
	E = \frac{w}{h} = \frac{(\frac{N}{\sqrt{Np\omega}} -1)}{\sqrt{Np\omega}-1}.
\end{equation}
For large $N$, the elongation can be approximated by
\begin{equation}
	E \approx \frac{1}{p\omega}.
\end{equation}
